# Image_manipulation_detection
Paper: CVPR2018, Learning Rich Features for Image Manipulation Detection
Code based on [Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/dBeker/Faster-RCNN-TensorFlow-Python3.5)

# Environment
Python 3.5
TensorFlow 1.8.0

# Note
The code requires a large memory GPU. If you do not have a 6G+ GPU, please reduce the number of noise stream conv layers for training
